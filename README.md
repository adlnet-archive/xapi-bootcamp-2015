#### What is this?
This is a repository of the session resources.

#### What happens?
**Day 1 (Tuesday, July 14):** This day is for those who want to learn about the Experience API (xAPI) and its applications - both for those looking for introductory sessions and those willing to get their hands dirty in design or development workshops. This is a great opportunity to get your xAPI questions answered.

**Day 2 (Wednesday, July 15):** This day is for xAPI Design Cohort final presentations. These sessions are the culmination of work done during the [third season of the xAPI Design Cohort](http://www.adlnet.gov/from-adl-team-member-craig-wiggins-xapi-design-cohort-season-3-kickoff/index.html). These presentations are opportunities to see showcased xAPI design and implementation, and to ask questions.

Day 2 will also include an all-day xAPI Collaboration Room: a place to bring your xAPI questions, projects and concerns to talk about with a rotating team of xAPI experts.
