#### Session description
This session will introduce the use of the Experience API (xAPI) in a 3D immersive virtual environment. Participants will construct a simple exercise in the ADL Sandbox - a virtual environment authoring tool. 

* This session will first introduce the Sandbox tools and give a brief demonstration. 
* Following the introduction, a library of interactive content will be provided for participants to use in the authoring of a simple exercise. 
* Authors will learn to add xAPI data tracking to their experience by intercepting events within the simulation, constructing xAPI statements, and posting those statements to an LRS. 
* After the authoring stage is complete, participants will have the opportunity to test each othersâ€™ exercises, while the system gathers data. 
* Finally, xAPI will be used to generate metrics about the performance of each user in each exercise.

#### Prerequisites
