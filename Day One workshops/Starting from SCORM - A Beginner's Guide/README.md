#### Session description
This session will discuss how to implement basic Experience API (xAPI) in the same way one would implement SCORM.  We’ll
* Talk about how concepts like packaging and launch could work with xAPI, how a session could be handled, as well as tracking completions, scores, and other traditional SCORM elements.  
* Discuss the basics of the Learning Record Store (LRS), especially in the context of having an LMS.
* Discuss best practices for search and retrieval of statements.

#### Prerequisites 
None, but a basic knowledge of xAPI (gained by attending the previous session) is helpful.  Understanding of the basics of SCORM (how it works, not implementation details) is useful for context.

#### What to bring with you
Nothing in particular.
