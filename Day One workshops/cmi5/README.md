#### Session description
cmi5 is an exciting extension to Experience xAPI (xAPI) which we call a profile.  cmi5 content is conformant to xAPI, but also has extra “rules” which provide structure and interoperability.  In this session, we'll give you the baseline of information that you need to know about the 'next generation of SCORM.'

#### Prerequisites 
Some knowledge of xAPI is helpful (one of the previous sessions should be sufficient), but not necessary.

#### What to bring with you
Nothing in particular.
