#### Session description
cmi5 is an exciting extension to Experience xAPI (xAPI) which we call a profile.  cmi5 content is conformant to xAPI, but also has extra “rules” which provide structure and interoperability.  In this session, we will discuss designing a learning activity with cmi5.  We’ll go over the basics of the specification, talk about how to create and tag Statements, and how to package it all together for delivery.

#### Prerequisites 
Some knowledge of xAPI is helpful (one of the previous sessions should be sufficient), but not necessary.

#### What to bring with you
Nothing in particular.
