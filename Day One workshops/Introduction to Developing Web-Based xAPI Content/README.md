#### Session description
This session will be an introduction to developing web-based Experience API (xAPI) Content with pre-built open source tools from ADL. It will first cover the syntax of an xAPI statement from a non-developer POV using [xAPI Remarks](http://adlnet.github.io/xapi-remarks/), and will gradually move to writing syntactically-correct xAPI statements with JSON. We will then validate these with the statement validator that is hosted on the Learning Record Store (LRS). The session will also cover the xAPI Javascript wrapper with examples, and will touch base with the Java wrapper ([jXAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/jxapi)) that is available.

#### Prerequisites 
Familiarity with HTML and Javascript, maybe Java
