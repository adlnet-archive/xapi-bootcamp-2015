#### Session description
In this session, we will build a real-world learning activity using Experience API (xAPI) Statements.  No computers are needed as we will construct Statements using office materials.  We will go over the basic parts of Statements, how both humans and machines read them, and how all parts work together to design a real solution.  (Hint:  We’ll be designing an “[Internet of Things](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Internet-of-Things)” xAPI integration, so bring your thinking caps!)

#### Prerequisites 
None.

#### What to bring with you
The aforementioned thinking caps.
